# Real Estate Price Prediction App

## Project Overview
This innovative real estate price prediction app leverages React.js for the frontend and Brain.js for implementing a neural network model to predict property prices. Developed by Jyothi Prasanna Kambam, the app analyzes features like area, number of bedrooms, and location to provide accurate price estimates.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes Brain.js for advanced property price forecasting.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React.js for a smooth, responsive experience.
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporates Chart.js for clear, interactive data representation.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Ensures a modern, mobile-responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Brain.js**: For implementing the neural network model.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the application.
- **Chart.js**: For data visualization.
